              <h1>Too good?</h1>

              <p>
                imagine that it’s the middle of the night, when goblins prowl, and your
                power goes out.
              </p>
              <p>
                But the light on your table doesn’t go out. Not only does the light on
                your table not go out, but if you want to move yourself away from the
                table and set up by the east window, where goblins enter, you can grab
                the light right off the lamp and stick in on a wall mount instead,
                shining brightly all the way.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then when you hear a noise downstairs that sounds like rustling
                cornflakes, which goblins eat, you can snatch that light right off of
                the wall mount and WALK DOWNSTAIRS WITH IT.
              </p>
              <p>Where the goblins are.</p>
              <p>But we’re not here to talk about goblins. That was a diversion.</p>
              <p>
                We’re really here to talk about this outrageously versatile table lamp
                that basically lets you move it around and carry it anywhere. It’s
                ridiculously cool technology, the likes of which hasn’t been seen since,
                like…candles, admittedly.
              </p>
              <p>
                But it’s not like you’re going to walk around with a candle anyway. What
                are you, some old-timey rich guy in striped pajamas and a stocking cap
                investigating the rattling chain noises of a ghost there to tell him to
                quit being such a Dickensian asshole all the time?
              </p>
              <p>
                No, you’re a [terminally online younger adult with an affinity for pop
                culture just slightly outside of the mainstream and an IRK fetish that
                probably says more about your early childhood development than it does
                about your interest in wireless speakers or unsolicited pasta]*.
              </p>
              <p>
                So as a [that thing we just said], you’re way more likely to go
                stumbling around in the dark using your phone flashlight, whether you’re
                frightening goblins or looking for the vape pen that just rolled under
                your futon.
              </p>

              <p>
                Either way, at this point it’s kind of time for you to admit that we’ve
                really got something with today’s deal. We both know you’re going to be
                deeply satisfied the first time you pop this thing off of its lamp base
                and stick it on the wall mount or use it to creep around the house
                quietly without turning on a bunch of lights.
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s basically the technological equivalent of one of those sink faucets
                with the pull-down hose thing, except instead of just using it to spray
                things in the sink you could walk it across the house to fill everyone’s
                water glass like a damn magic trick. Except—with light.
              </p>
              <p>
                It’s very, very cool. There we said it. If this were any better it would
                be inconsistent with our business model. Buy one before we come to our
                senses.
              </p>
              <p>
                *Maybe. Large-scale personal data harvesting is expensive and involves a
                lot of math so we kind of wing it.
